==================

Makes a book!

Installation
------------

First, install Node. Then:

    npm install
    npm install wzrd -g

Usage
-----

    make run    

Then, wzrd will say something like:

    wzrd index.js
    server started at http://localhost:9966

You can open your browser to that.

Run `make prettier` (expects you to have run `npm install -g prettier`) and `eslint .` before committing.

Run `make build` to build the index.js.

License
-------

You can look, but you can't use without asking.

(I have to do some reading and thinking about licenses. I have a moratorium on slapping the MIT license on everything until then.)
